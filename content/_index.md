### About me

Hi! This is the personal blog of Jordan Binskin - all opinions my own. 
I'm interested in **development**. 

I appreciate this minimal theme, as it is nostalgic to me of a time of more simple web, without bootstrap and all the polish.

~~~javascript
const jordan = () => console.log('hello')
~~~

I intend to use this platform to share learnings, and link to any of my projects I see worth sharing.
